# Emerging Technologies in Federated Learning

**Authors**: Felix Plantenberg, Ivayla Ivanova

## Summary
Federated learning is a machine learning paradigm that solves distributed optimization tasks. Data is shared across a large number of devices which learn a joint prediction model. The goal is to preserve privacy-sensitive data locally on each device, while propagating encrypted updates to a central server. This review presents the general principles and architectures of fed- erated learning and analyzes solutions to various privacy issues in the field of secure computation, verifiability and other privacy-preserving techniques. By investigating the question whether federated learning preserves privacy, five factors are identified that emerge when utilizing proven techniques incorporated into the federated learning model which are additional model complexity, computational overhead, decreased model utility, reduced model accuracy and introducing trusted intermediate parties.
